Develop a Python chatbot capable of engaging in conversation with
users. The chatbot should understand natural language input and
respond appropriately, providing relevant information or assistance.
Utilize natural language processing techniques to enhance the bot's
ability to interpret user queries accurately. Ensure the chatbot's
responses are contextually relevant and contribute to a seamless
user experience.Additionally, Imagine you've been tasked with
creating comprehensive documentation for a Python Chatbot
project.Your documentation should include detailed explanations of
the code along with images illustrating the program's execution and
user interactions.
import nltk
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer
import random

nltk.download('punkt')

# Predefined greetings and responses
greetings = ["hi", "hello", "hey"]
responses = ["Hi there!", "Hey! How can I help you today?", "Glad you're here! What's on your mind?"]

# Preprocess user input for better understanding
def preprocess(text):
  tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(text.lower())
  stemmer = PorterStemmer()
  stems = [stemmer.stem(word) for word in tokens]
  return stems

# Function to handle user input and respond accordingly
def chat():
  while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    stems = preprocess(user_input)

    # Check for greetings
    if any(word in stems for word in greetings):
      print(random.choice(responses))
      continue

    # Add more conversation logic here based on user intent
    # (e.g., using keyword matching, NLTK libraries for sentiment analysis)

    print("Chatbot: I'm still learning, how can I improve?")

# Start the chat session
chat()
